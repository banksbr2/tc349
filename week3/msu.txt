MSU’s Homepage	When first arriving at MSU’s home page, I noticed how easy it was to navigate through their website. There are so many links right at the top of the page for different types of visitors. I have learned that ease of navigation can make or break to success of a website.	Michigan State’s homepage shows a good choice of colors and layouts. All of the main colors have been included in several different jerseys and uniforms that MSU sports teams have used. There is good use of flash that shows you some up to date information about some things going on at MSU. 	I hope that one day that I can make a webpage that is as well layed-out and color coordinated as this page that we are critiquing. And I hope that this course helps get me closer to that goal.
