<h1>Card Sorting</h1>

<p>The card sorting process intially seemed like a waste of time. The website Foldable.me, from a first glance, seemed organized nicely and that nothing should be moved around for improvement. Then, after searching through all of the links and content, I gained new opinions about the site. Some things seemed hidden away but then I realized that the consentration of the that website should be, <em>that website!</em> So there are some things that can be improved but for this websites' purpose, what's the point. </p>
<p>The findings from using Xsort on a macbook pro show that there are not many ways to change the Foldable.me website. The three people I chose all came up with similar results. The main differences between the seperate results are found in the categories of <em>Contact</em> and <em>Blog</em>. These are the same differences from user to webpage. None of my findings are exactly the same as what can be seen on the Foldable.me web page.</p>
