<h1>The Future of Brandon's Site</h1>
<p>There are plenty of ideas to improve on my personal site. I know that what I have right now for the site is very simple work and has not had enough time put in to it. I need to work out content, color scheme, and the layout. Once I improve on those things, I will be heading in the right direction to make the website look like the real thing.</p>
<p>I created a bunch of cards that I wanted to include in my personal site that interest me and tell more about myself. I also thought about selecting a color scheme that shows more of me by using my favorite colors or colors from either high school, college, or one of the sports teams from a center of which I am  from. I have allowed some associates of mine to selected the cards for content, including the color scheme (in order from best to worst). </p>
<p> From my findings, I have learned of some helpful details. I have a top 3 color schemes for the website and I want to keep that consistent throughout the different links. I now know that I should go back through this experiment with new groupings and cards because my original cards may have not flowed well, accoring to my participants. So I have to figure out what needs to be taken off of the webpage and to organize it better. </p>
