Brandon BanksChartbeat      The Chartbeat website is simple and straight to the point. The point of the webpage is to monitor websites. You can use the Chartbeat to monitor your website to see how often your page is visited, where is the traffic coming from, exactly what part of the page is being viewed and even how often each visitor scrolls through the page. All of this can be very helpful when determining the success and options of improvement for people’s websites. The company is soon to release shops and games websites where you can measure details on online gaming and merchandisers.	The style and flow of the Chartbeat webpage is very intriguing. As you scroll down the page of the site you see so much interacting with you while you scroll. The website is tailored to tell you how many pixels you have scrolled, circular shapes moves in circular motions as you scroll, and icons move vertically. This movements and interactions are certainly advanced wed design and exhibit of great cascading style sheet write-ups.  	The color scheme is great to me as well. The color scheme consists of mostly different shades of blue, a little bit of orange and black and white in other places. I have noticed a lot of different web sites using blue and orange schemes but this one is still different from those websites I have noticed. If I had a REAL website, I would definitely want to use Chartbeat, or at least something like it.
