eBay Mobile

	I chose the eBay mobile application because that is the most used mobile site I use. In the videos for the week, you mentioned that applications are just the mobile dedicated versions of the desktop, if I stated that correctly.

	I like using this website much more that the desktop versions mainly because of its touchscreen interactions that you cannot do on most desktops. This interaction allows me the user to search through their inventory much faster and it is more entertaining than scrolling down the screen. 

	The layout of the eBay application version is simple, and resembles the desktop version a bit. The same colors and backgrounds are used from the desktop site. The gallery format is used much for listings of inventory, showing pictures with brief details of each item. Navigation through the site is much easier as well.
