	I like the interactions of the website. Almost everything that the cursor contacts moves or changes color. For example, on the linked page called Pixelivery, the brand?s icon background changes colors when the cursor is on it. As a viewer, this sites interest me and it is interesting how everything is laid out. There is actually a few different layouts within this one site that is put together well.

	There is a lot of information and linked websites connected to this page. Even though blogs with articles are mostly designed the same,  it would be nice if the United Pixelworkers blog page have links to the different articles on the side. While checking out the site, it seemed like a lot and made me leave the site. If it was searchable with navigation links, there?s a chance that people can see something that interest them and keep them on your site. 

The color scheme is pretty simple. It consist of a plain white background, dark blue top and bottom borders and some random blue and red accessories like search bars and backgrounds of content.
