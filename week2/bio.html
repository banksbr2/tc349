<h2> A "Panic.com" Critic </h2>

<p> The website, www.panic.com, is wonderful! I really like the layout and colors used. It's easy to navigate and seems very interesting. The links on the main page, suck as to the blog and other applications, really catch my attention for me to return back to the website for leisure. </p>

<p> The blog has some amazing articles on there. There are applications and such that allow you to beef up the security on your Mac computer and have fun playing around in the terminal's command lines. I will surely be spreading the word about this site to my friends and other Mac owners.</p>
