Vimeo	I like Vimeo’s website. It’s a website about videos, so there are a lot of videos on the site and it even has videos to help you make better videos. It seems to have a lot of interesting content on there that several different types of people would like. I think the site is both educational and fun.	 I noticed a few things about the site that I did not pay attention to that often before taking this course. There is no set width of the site so the smaller you make the width of the browser, the less you can see rather making everything jammed inside of a small view. And the layout of most of the sites branched from vimeo.com, consist of a grid of videos as the main content with several links and information on the top, sides, and bottoms of the pages.
