	The website etsy.com has a nice layout. I found it very easy to navigate through the different links within the website. The main navigation is consistent on each page and it even has a search bar including in navigation that makes navigation even easier in most situations. I like that the designer put the upcoming holiday right at the top of the page, that could help get more attention and sales. I myself even clicked on it to find something for my girlfriend, so it is obvious that the set up worked in luring me to the valentine’s products.

	I agreed with the color scheme that was chosen. I usually have a hard time with out assignments on what color scheme would be ok. It is a simple color set up. It is pretty much a white background, with grey navigation, blue fonts, and a burnt orange color for the logo page that happens to look great when put together. It also seems to be very interactive. When you put your cursor over a picture, an icon appears in the corner of that picture. I like the smile things like that and visitors would probably agree with me.
