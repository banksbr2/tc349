Heroku.com

The Heroku website is much different than the other websites we have had to review so far. The flow of the websites, color schemes, interactions, and complete set up, it?s all different. The website is organized pretty well in my opinion. Anything that I initially wanted to find appeared to be easily accessible on that site. I believe that it is very user friendly for even the simplest internet users. The website is to help make creating web apps easier for others though cloud computing.

The website color scheme is very dark, which is completely different from our other sites. It?s a dark purple and black, those are it?s main colors. Heroku colors also consist of lime green and blue that stands out a lot. The layout on every page is very consistent and fluid, which I believe is a goal for most web developers. I really liked how you could click on certain parts of an almost solid diagram and get the desired information. I really like this website. Websites like heroku.com, are the reasons why I am so interested in learning more about wed design and hoping to become much better in that process.
