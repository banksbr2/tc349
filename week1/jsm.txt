I have seen sites like www.jasonsantamaria.com before, but very rarely. It is a very simple design but gets the job done. There are clear navigation links on the top of every page so that even if its your first time visiting the site you would not have a problem getting around the site. I like the simple colors and designs.The site reminds me of a blog, forum and even like a newspaper article. I understand that the website is an experiment, according to the author Jason Santa Maria, so I do expect there to be some changes to the appearance of the site. The simple look is nice but I would definitely add a few things like maybe bordering for the sides of the site to reduce white space.
