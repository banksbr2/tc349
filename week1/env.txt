I chose Dreamweaver to do TC349 work on. I am a bit familiar with this software, well more familiar than I am with any of the other applications suggested. Therefor, I believe that using this software will make my assignments a tad bit easier than trying on a different software.I understand how Dreamweaver works and how I "could" use it to do most of the work when creating certain file types. However, I plan to learn in this course I can do so by having the software do work for me. Honestly, I did not check out any of the other applications because I already have access to Dreamweaver, which is pretty popular. I have juggled the decision of using the same software as the professor so that following along with the videos will be less difficult.
