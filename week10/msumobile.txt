MSU Mobile

	The MSU mobile site is definitely a dedicated mobile site. It?s completely different than that desktop site. It is almost set up like an application in my opinion, the way the there is only icons and a search bar initially. As far as organization for a mobile site, it seems to get the job done. From the icons that are available, it is easy to search for things or just look around to discover things.

	The color layout is as expected, dark green colors representing MSU colors. This mobile site is setup and runs just as you would expect. However, it does not seem to give you all the same access to information like the desktop site.
